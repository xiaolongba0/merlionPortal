                <h3>What we do:</h3>
                <div>Being one of the most preferred regional or global operating base for many major logistics firms, Singapore has proved itself to be a global logistic hub. 20 out of 25 global logistics players conduct their operations here. The tremendous growth of international trade over the past few years due to globalization has opened up a huge demand for logistics and supply chain services. Singapore’s strategic location in the heart of Southeast Asia and at the intersection of major shipping lanes has created an increase in demand for logistics services provided in Singapore.
                    Merlion Investment Holdings, one of Singapore’s largest private equity firms, had decided to invest S$5 billion to establish Merlion Logistics, a 5PL logistics provider.
                    As part of its business preparation, Merlion Logistics has decided to develop a custom 5PL management platform, the MerLION Platform. This Platform is expected to handle all logistics, supply chain and transport operations of Merlion Logistics and its partner.
                    In order to provide an integrated suite of outsourced logistics services for 1PLs to 4PLs, we propose a MerLION Platform, which offers the following key functions:</div>
